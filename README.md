1. Project Overview
The  Banking Application is a Java-based console application that allows users to perform fundamental banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and checking balances. It integrates with a MySQL database to store account details, implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

2. Technologies Used
Java: Core language used for the application logic.
MySQL: Database to store account details.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Interface used to connect the Java application to the MySQL database.
MySQL Connector/J: JDBC driver to communicate with MySQL from Java.
IDE: Any Java IDE such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse.

4. Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or above).
MySQL installed and running.
MySQL Connector/J (JDBC Driver) added to the project.
Basic understanding of SQL and Java.

IDE: Ensure that the IDE (e.g., VS Code) is properly set up for Java development.





5. Setting Up the MySQL Database
Create Database and Table: Before running the Java application, set up your MySQL database.

Database Creation Script: Open MySQL Workbench (or any other client) and run the following SQL queries to create the necessary database and table:


CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS banking_db;
USE banking_db;

-- Drop the accounts table if it exists (to prevent conflicts)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS accounts;

-- Create the accounts table
CREATE TABLE accounts (
    account_number VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    holder_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    balance DOUBLE NOT NULL
);
6. Project Execution Steps
6.1. Setting Up the Project
Create a Project Directory:

Open a terminal and create a new project directory:

mkdir BankingApp
cd BankingApp
Set Up Directory Structure:

Inside your project folder, create the following directories:

mkdir src
mkdir lib
mkdir src/banking
Add MySQL Connector JAR:

Download the MySQL Connector/J from MySQL's official site.
Place the JAR file in the lib folder inside your project directory.
6.2. Writing Code
BankAccount.java, BankApp.java, and DatabaseConnection.java should be placed in the src/banking/ directory.
6.3. Compiling the Project
Compile the Java Files: Open a terminal in your project root and use the following command to compile your Java files. Ensure you include the MySQL Connector JAR in the classpath:



javac -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar" src/banking/*.java
Windows: Use ; as the classpath separator.
Linux/macOS: Use : instead of ;.
Check for Compilation Errors: Ensure all files are compiled without errors before proceeding.

6.4. Running the Application
Run the Application: After compiling the project, run the main class (BankApp.java) using the following command:


java -cp ".;lib/mysql-connector-j-9.0.0.jar;src" banking.BankApp


Interaction:

The console will display a menu where you can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and check balances.
The data will be stored and retrieved from the MySQL database.
7. CRUD Operations Explanation
Create: Create a new bank account and store it in the database.
Read: Retrieve account details and check balance.
Update: Deposit and withdraw money, updating the balance in the database.
Delete: Optionally, functionality can be extended to delete accounts from the database.

 Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation for learning how to implement CRUD operations in a Java application with a MySQL database. With further customization and enhancement, it can be expanded into a full-fledged banking system.
